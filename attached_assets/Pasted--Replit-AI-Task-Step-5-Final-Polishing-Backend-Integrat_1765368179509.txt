# Replit AI Task: Step 5 – Final Polishing & Backend Integration

## Instructions
AI, execute the following tasks **carefully and in order**. Only work on the tasks listed below. **Do not touch unrelated pages or backend routes.**

---

### **Task 1: Connect Saved Properties to Backend**
1. Update `/pages/SavedProperties.jsx`:
   - Fetch real saved properties from backend:
     - `GET /api/saved-properties`
   - Connect “Save/Unsave” buttons to backend:
     - `POST /api/saved-properties` → save property
     - `DELETE /api/saved-properties/:id` → remove property
   - Keep local dummy fallback until API is ready.
   - Ensure responsive grid layout and smooth transitions.

---

### **Task 2: Complete Admin Panel CRUD Operations (Partial)**
1. Update `/pages/AdminPanel.jsx`:
   - Enable creating/deleting agents and property listings via backend.
   - Apply `adminAuth` middleware to all admin routes.
   - Keep table display of applications and stats intact.
   - Ensure all buttons have hover/focus animations.

---

### **Task 3: Implement Image Upload in ListProperty**
1. Update `/pages/ListProperty.jsx`:
   - Fully integrate ImageKit file upload.
   - Preview selected images before submission.
   - Connect to `/api/properties` endpoint so images are saved in database.
   - Keep form validation intact.

---

### **Task 4: Final Auth & Permissions Checks**
1. Verify backend JWT middleware for admin-only routes:
   - `GET /api/applications` → admin only
   - `POST /api/agents` → admin only
   - `DELETE /api/properties/:id` → admin only
2. Ensure normal users cannot access admin endpoints.
3. Return proper error messages for unauthorized requests.

---

### **Task 5: Minor UX Polishing**
1. Ensure all toast notifications are working on:
   - Apply.jsx
   - Contact.jsx
   - ListProperty.jsx
   - SavedProperties.jsx
2. Add smooth loading animations on dashboard tables.
3. Check button spacing, hover states, and alignment across all new pages.

---

### **Important Notes**
- **Do not modify unrelated components or routes.**
- Ensure backward compatibility: existing workflows should continue running without errors.
- Keep code modular and clean.
- Apply responsive design for all new/updated pages.

---

**After completing these tasks:**
- Saved properties feature fully functional.
- Admin panel CRUD partially functional with stats and application display.
- Image upload works correctly in ListProperty.
- Admin routes enforce permissions.
- Minor UI/UX issues fixed.
